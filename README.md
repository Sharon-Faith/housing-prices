#### A Jupyter notebook
#### By **Sharon Faith**
## Description
The notebook contains the analysis on a project whose main objectives were to investigate factors that affect housing prices using the information provided in [this dataset](http://bit.ly/IndependentProjectWeek7Dataset) and to create a model that will enable the accurate prediction of the sale price of a house. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis and modelling (multilinear, lasso, ridge, elastic net, and quantile regression) were carried out to aid in achieving the objectives.
